# ThreeJS-3d-Project
3D Car Showcase with Three.js Welcome to my 3D Car Showcase project! This is a visually stunning web application that features a 3D car model with smooth animations, interactive controls, and scroll-based effects. Built using Three.js, GSAP, and Vite, this project demonstrates my skills in 3D web development and front-end design.
